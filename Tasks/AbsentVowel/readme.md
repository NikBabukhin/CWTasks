Your job is to figure out the index of which vowel is missing from a given string:<br/>
*A has an index of 0*<br/>
*E has an index of 1*<br/>
*I has an index of 2*<br/>
*O has an index of 3*<br/>
*U has an index of 4*<br/>
*Notes*: There is no need for string validation and every sentence given will contain all vowels but one. Also, you won't need to worry about capitals
