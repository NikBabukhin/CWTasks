Given a string, turn each character into its ASCII character code and join them together to create a number - let's call this number *total1*:<br/>
Then replace any incidence of the number *7* with the number *1*, and call this number *total2*:<br/>
Then return the difference between the sum of the digits in *total1* and *total2*:
