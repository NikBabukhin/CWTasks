Write a function that returns true if the number is a "Very Even" number.<br/>
If a number is a single digit, then it is simply "Very Even" if it itself is even.<br/>
If it has 2 or more digits, it is "Very Even" if the sum of its digits is "Very Even".<br/>

*I will solve this Kata with recursion, but I think there is a simpler solution*
